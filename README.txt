Highest Stage: Sphere Collision Completed (No sparse matrices)
No bonus

I probably should have just moved on to sparse matrices, but I got distracted with
adding new shapes to the simulation! I ended up making an atom that moves around the 
scene, and you can press 'a' to toggle it on and off. It looks pretty cool, if I do 
say so myself :D
